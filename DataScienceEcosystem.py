# - A few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

# 1. Numpy
# 2. TensorFlow
# 3. Pandas

# |Data Science Tools|

# |RStudio|
# |Apache Spark|
# |TensorFlow|

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
# 

# In[3]:


(3*4)+5


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

# In[5]:


minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
